## 🔧 About Me

I'm a senior at the University of Houston studying Computer Science, with a minor in Data Science & Math. I enjoy working on practical, secure tools that solve real problems. Right now, I'm focused on full stack development, backend systems, and exploring DevOps practices.

Looking for internship or entry-level opportunities for 2025–2026 where I can contribute, grow, and work with solid teams.
